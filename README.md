The data is collected from TED talks. More detailed information about the data, please go to https://github.com/ngovinhtn/LowresMT/Datasets

## Datasets 

### 1. English-Vietnamese  
| Dataset       | Sentences | 
| ------------- | --------- | 
| Training Data | 231004 |
| Development (tst2012)  | 1553 |
| Test (tst2013)        | 1268 |

## Performance 
The results of our MT systems are measured in BLEU. We evaluate the best model for the baseline systems and the average scores on the five best models for the multilingual and pseudo systems. More details, please see our paper https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.loresmt-1.8.pdf
